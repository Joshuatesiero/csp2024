	    <h1 style="color:white;">Project 1.1.9</h1>
	<img src="https://github.com/Joshuatesiero/csp2024/blob/main/119%20project.PNG?raw=true">
	<p style="color:white;"> For the 1.1.9 project, the user gets to pick toppings for a pizza, then it is cooked and cut. This project we had to use </p>
	<p style="color:white;">if statements and use movement. We also learned how to make backgrounds and images in python.</p>
	<br>
	<h1 style="color:white;">Project 1.2.5</h1>
	<img src="https://github.com/Joshuatesiero/csp2024/blob/main/Capture.PNG?raw=true" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p style="color:white;"> For the 1.2.5 project, we made a game, like snake, where a shark swims around and eats fish for points. The shark also can't hit the </p>
	<p style="color:white;">gorilla because then that will end in a loss. There is also a leaderboard that records the names of the player and how much they score.</p>
	<br>
	<h1 style="color:white;">Project 1.3.1</h1>
	<img src="https://github.com/Joshuatesiero/csp2024/blob/main/project%201.3.1.PNG?raw=true" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p style="color:white;"> For the 1.3.1 project, we made a Halloween card for a children's hospital. This card was built to be fun and replayable, so we added the</p>
	<p style="color:white;"> ability for a random image to be displayed if they picked trick or treat. We also add confetti at the end to make it more fun.</p>
	<br>
	<h1 style="color:white;">Project 2.1.6</h1>
	<img src="https://github.com/Joshuatesiero/csp2024/blob/main/fishtank.PNG?raw=true" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p style="color:white;"> For the 2.1.6 project, instead of making a game, we had to look through evidence about a security breach. We also had to debug code</p>
	<p style="color:white;"> for a fishtank monitoring system that was giving unexpected errors. We then fixed the code and identified where the security breach happened</p>
